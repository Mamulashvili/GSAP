draw basic shapes and animate with gsap

The `gsap` object serves as the access point for most of GSAP's functionality. It's just a generic object with various methods and properties that create and control `Tweens` and `Timelines`;

```js
const tl = gsap.timeline();
tl.from(target, optionsObj, position)
```
